use POST to create resources, or use PUT to update resources.

Use PUT when you can update a resource completely through a specific resource. For instance, if you know that an article resides at http://example.org/article/1234, you can PUT a new resource representation of this article directly through a PUT on this URL.

If you do not know the actual resource location, for instance, when you add a new article, but do not have any idea where to store it, you can POST it to an URL, and let the server decide the actual URL.

PUT /article/1234 

HTTP/1.1
<article>
    <title>red stapler</title>
    <price currency="eur">12.50</price>
</article>
POST /articles 

HTTP/1.1
<article>
    <title>blue stapler</title>
    <price currency="eur">7.50</price>
</article>

HTTP/1.1 
201 Created
Location: /articles/63636



POST to a URL creates a child resource at a server defined URL.
Eg. /items/1

PUT to a URL creates/replaces the resource in its entirety at the client defined URL.
PUT replaces the resource at the known url if it already exists, so sending the same request twice has no effect. In other words, calls to PUT are idempotent.

PATCH to a URL updates part of the resource at that client defined URL.
